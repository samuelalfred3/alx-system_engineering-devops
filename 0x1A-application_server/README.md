## Concepts
In this project, we delve into the following concepts:
- Web Server
- Server
- Web stack debugging
- Application server vs web server

## Background Context
The web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx, installed in the first web stack project. However, dynamic content handling, typically assigned to an application server, is lacking. This project aims to integrate an application server (Flask) into the infrastructure to serve dynamic content for the Airbnb clone project.
